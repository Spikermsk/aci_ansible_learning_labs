# Application and Network Policy with Ansible

Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) has several tools to help you build and operate the ACI Fabric programmatically using its APIs. Some of these tools include the API Inspector, ACI Cobra SDK, and ACI Toolkit.  All of these tools are covered in other DevNet Learning Labs too!

The labs in this learning module walk you through using the newest way to automate ACI--using Ansible by Red Hat. The benefit of using Ansible, specifically ACI modules in Ansible, is that it takes away the need to write and develop custom scripts, since the modules are essentially scripts written to perform a particular task. This saves you time from having to research API requests, developing code to make the proper API request, and from testing and debugging the code.

**In this lab we take a look at the ACI modules used for creating and managing Application and Network Policy!**
