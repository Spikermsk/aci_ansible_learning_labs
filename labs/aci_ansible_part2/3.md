## Executing the Playbook and Adding a VRF, Bridge Domain, and Subnet

Now that you are familiar with the Tenant Networking modules, it is time to execute the playbook.

In the [first lab in this module](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/modules/ansible-aci-intro/aci_ansible_part1/step/5), you created the Tenant.  Now running this playbook will create a new VRF, Bridge Domain, and Subnet for this Tenant.

Ansible allows you to pass variables to the playbook through the command shell using the `--extra-vars` flag (or `-e` for short hand syntax). The format is `--extra-vars "var1=value1 var2=value2"` where `var1` and `var2` are variables used in the playbook and **value1** and **value2** are their desired values for this execution. For our playbook, we will use `"vrf=prod_vrf"` and let the `bd` variable use the default of `prod_db`.

Follow along in your command shell to execute the Tenant Networking Playbook:

> Make sure to use the same Tenant name you used for the previous playbook!!

```bash
$ ansible-playbook 02_aci_tenant_network_pb.yml -i inventory --extra-vars "vrf=prod_vrf"

Navigate back to your Tenant in the APIC GUI, and follow these steps to validate the Networks exist:

* Expand the "Networking" folder
* Expand the "Bridge Domains" folder to see the prod_db bridge domain you created.
* Expand the "prod_db" folder
* Expand the "Subnets" folder to view the subnet you created
* Expand the "VRFs" folder to view the VRF you created
