## Tenant Application Modules

There are four modules needed to build an Application Profile with EPGs:
* `aci_ap`
* `aci_epg`
* `aci_epg_to_domain`
* `aci_epg_to_contract`

Open the `04_aci_tenant_app_pb.yml` file and we will discuss each module and look at the example provided in the playbook.

### App Profile Module

Managing Application Network Profiles is done using the `aci_ap` module. In ACI, App Profiles are used as containers for the services that make up an application. Since they are more orginizational, there is only one new parameter: `ap` is used to ensure an App Profile is in the desired state.

The first task in the playbook is used to ensure the App Profile exists for the EPGs.

```yaml
    - name: ENSURE APPLICATION EXISTS
      aci_ap:
        host: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
        username: "{{ username }}"
        password: "{{ password }}"
        state: "present"
        validate_certs: false
        tenant: "{{ tenant }}"
        ap: "{{ ap }}"
        descr: "App Profile Created Using Ansible"
```

### EPG Module

The `aci_epg` module is used to manage an Application's End Point Groups. EPGs have several configuration items, we highlight a few that the module supports:
* `ap:` The Application Profile name that the EPG belongs to
* `epg:` The name of the EPG
* `bd:` The Bridge Domain which hosts belonging to the EPG should be associated with. This determines what broadcast domain the hosts are connected to, and what IP Subnets are available for them to use.

The second task in the playbook is used to ensure the "web" and "db" EPGs exist for our aplication.

```yaml
    - name: ENSURE APPLICATION EPGS EXISTS
      aci_epg:
        host: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
        username: "{{ username }}"
        password: "{{ password }}"
        state: "present"
        validate_certs: False
        tenant: "{{ tenant }}"
        ap: "{{ ap }}"
        epg: "{{ item.epg }}"
        bd: "prod_bd"
        description: "EPG Created Using Ansible"
      with_items: "{{ epgs }}"
```

Looking at this task, you will notice the with_items is using a variable named `epgs`. Go ahead and open `./vars/intranet_vars.yml` and you will see a file with the playbook's variables. Change the `tenant` value to the name of the Tenant you have been using in this lab.

```yaml
---
  tenant: CHANGEME
  ap: "intranet"
  epgs:
    - epg: "web"
      encap: "21"
      contract_type: "both"
      consumer: "sql"
      provider: "web"
    - epg: "sql"
      encap: "22"
      contract_type: "provider"
      provider: "sql"
  epg_contracts:
    - epg: "web"
      contract: "web"
      contract_type: "provider"
    - epg: "web"
      contract: "sql"
      contract_type: "consumer"
    - epg: "sql"
      contract: "sql"
      contract_type: "provider"
```

The `epgs` key looks similar to the lists we have been using in previous playbooks, but now we can pass the same data to multiple tasks without having to rewrite for each task.

### EPG and Domain Binding

The `aci_epg_to_domain` module is used to manage EPG to Domain Bindings (VMM and Physical).
* `ap:` The Application Profile name that the EPG belongs to
* `epg:` The name of the EPG to associate to the domain
* `domain:` The name of the VMM or Physical domain to associate with the EPG
* `domain_type:` Determines if the domain is physical or virtual. The options are "phys" for physical and "vmm" for hypervisor integrations.
* `vm_provider`: When managing a VMM Domain, this determines what vendor is being used for the hypervisor. This is required if the `domain_type` is vmm.
* `encap_mode:` When managing a VMM Domain, this determines if the VLAN or VXLAN will be used.
* `encap:` Assigns a VLAN number to a VMM Domain when using static assignments.

```yaml
    - name: ENSURE DOMAIN IS BOUND TO EPG
      aci_epg_to_domain:
        host: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
        username: "{{ username }}"
        password: "{{ password }}"
        state: "present"
        validate_certs: false
        tenant: "{{ tenant }}"
        ap: "{{ ap }}"
        epg: "{{ item.epg }}"
        domain: "aci_ansible_lab"
        domain_type: "vmm"
        vm_provider: "vmware"
        encap_mode: "auto"
        encap: "{{ item.encap }}"
      with_items: "{{ epgs }}"
```

Notice that this task also uses the same `epgs` variable as the previous task, which saves us from having to rewrite the config data a second time, and helps to keep the values consistent across tasks.

### Binding EPGs to Contracts
The `aci_epg_to_contract` module is used to manage the Contracts that are associated with an EPG. This module uses the naming parameters from `aci_tenant`, `aci_ap`, `aci_epg`, and `aci_contract` modules. One additional parameter is `contract_type` used to indicate if the EPG is a `provider` or `consumer` of the contract.

Look back at the last task in the Playbook:
```yaml
    - name: ENSURE EPG IS ASSOCIATED TO CONTRACTS
      aci_epg_to_contract:
        host: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
        username: "{{ username }}"
        password: "{{ password }}"
        state: "present"
        validate_certs: False
        tenant: "{{ tenant }}"
        ap: "{{ ap }}"
        epg: "{{ item.epg }}"
        contract: "{{ item.contract }}"
        contract_type: "{{ item.contract_type }}"
      with_items: "{{ epg_contracts }}"
```
