## Executing the Playbook and Adding ACI Filters and Contracts

Ansible has different levels of verbosity that you can set when calling from the command shell; typically you will want to see the full return values from the playbook execution. Adding `-vvv` to the playbook call will print the module's return data back to the command shell (stdout). We will call the `03_aci_tenant_policies_pb.yml` as we did the previous playbooks, but this time increase the verbosity to see the results.

Follow along in your command shell to execute the Tenant Networking Playbook
>Make sure to use the same Tenant name you used for the previous playbooks

```
$ ansible-playbook 03_aci_tenant_policies_pb.yml -i inventory -vvv

We have shown just the first task from the first play, but the module execution outputs the same type of data for each task that is ran. Looking at the returned results, the data returned matches what was covered earlier in this lab. In this example, the existing value is an empty list since the object did not exist. Also, proposed and config dictionaries are mostly identical (the identifier is used in the URL, so it is not passed in the final request).
