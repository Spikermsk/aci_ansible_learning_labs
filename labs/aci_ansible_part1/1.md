# Start Automating Cisco ACI with Ansible

Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) has several tools to help you build and operate the ACI Fabric programmatically using its APIs. Some of these tools include the API Inspector, ACI Cobra SDK, and ACI Toolkit.  All of these tools are covered in other DevNet Learning Labs too!

The labs in this learning module walk you through using the newest way to automate ACI--using Ansible by Red Hat. The benefit of using Ansible, specifically ACI modules in Ansible, is that it takes away the need to write and develop custom scripts, since the modules are essentially scripts written to perform a particular task. This saves you time from having to research API requests, developing code to make the proper API request, and from testing and debugging the code.

In this lab we take a look at the ACI modules and start by creating Tenants!  

## Prerequisites

The user has an understanding and knowledge of the following:

- Complete the Devnet ACI Learning Lab(s)
  - [Introduction to ACI Programmability](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/modules/intro-to-aci)
  - [Intermediate ACI Programmability](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/modules/intermediate-aci-prog)
- Basic Ansible
  - [https://learninglabs.cisco.com/modules/sdx-ansible-intro]
- Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI)
- You have local machine with Linux or OS X pre-installed
  - Windows is **not** supported as an Ansible Control Station
- Complete the **How To Setup Your Own Computer** instructions above.

## Using This Lab

This lab uses the Always-On ACI Simulator available through the DevNet Sandbox environment; details for connecting to the APIC can be found at https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Topology. The files we will use in this lab can be found at https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/aci_ansible_learning_labs_code_samples. You can download or clone the files to your local Linux-based machine.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/aci_ansible_learning_labs_code_samples
$ cd aci_ansible_learning_labs_code_samples/intro_module
$ ls

01_aci_tenant_pb.yml		
03_aci_tenant_policies_pb.yml
05_aci_deploy_app.yml		
07_lab_cleanup.yml		
vars
02_aci_tenant_network_pb.yml
04_aci_tenant_app_pb.yml
06_aci_rest_pb.yml		
inventory
```

This lab assumes you are familiar with Ansible and have Ansible 2.4 or greater installed on your machine. If you do not have Ansible installed, or have an earlier version, then the latest version can be installed using **pip**:

```bash
$ pip install ansible
...
install logs
...
$
```

For additional installation help, please see Ansible documentation at http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_installation.html.
