### Executing the Playbook and Creating a Tenant

Now return to the directory, `REPLACEME`, that has all of the files you cloned.  Make sure you are in the directory containing the `01_aci_tenant_pb.yml`.

**When the playbook  prompts you for the Tenant's name, use your initials and zip code to form the name. For example, John Smith who lives in zip code 10018, would create the tenant name js_10118, as also shown below:**

When you are in the correct directory, execute the playbook:


```bash
$ ansible-playbook 01_aci_tenant_pb.yml -i inventory
What would you like to name your Tenant?: js_10018
PLAY [ENSURE APPLICATION CONFIGURATION EXISTS] ***************************************************************************************

TASK [ENSURE APPLICATIONS TENANT EXISTS] ********************************************************************************************
changed: [apic1]

PLAY RECAP ***************************************************************************************************************************
apic1                      : ok=1    changed=1    unreachable=0    failed=0
$
```

This should be a unique tenant (assuming no one else with your initials that lives in your Zip code is currently on this APIC!!!) , so you should have results of **ok=1** and **changed=1**.

You can also check the APIC to validate your new Tenant existS:
* Click on Tenants
* Double-Click on your Tenant to open it

When you open your Tenant, you will see its children on the left-hand navbar; you can use these to validate your playbooks work as expected throughout this lab. We will guide you through validating the Tenant Network modules, and you can continue to check the APIC GUI as you wish after each task for change verification.
