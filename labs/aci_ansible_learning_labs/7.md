## Building One Playbook For Application Deployment
This lab has broken up the various configuration pieces that are required to build an application in ACI into separate playbooks. For day to day operations, it would be useful to have 1 playbook that can be used to automate the process of configuring new applications.

### Tags

The `05_aci_deploy_app.yml` playbook is a collection of all the tasks in this lab, with a few changes made so that all of variables are retrieved from a vars file. In your command shell, use the `--list-tasks` argument to generate a preview of this playbook:

**NEEDS UPDATE ONCE MODULES ARE DONE BEING RENAMED**
```
$ ansible-playbook 05_aci_deploy_app.yml -i inventory --list-tasks

playbook: 05_aci_deploy_app.yml

  play #1 (apic): ENSURE APPLICATION CONFIGURATION EXISTS TAGS: []
    tasks:
      TASK 01 - ENSURE APPLICATIONS TENANT EXISTS TAGS: [app, bd, contract, epg, filter, tenant, vrf]
      TASK 02 - ENSURE TENANT VRF EXISTS  TAGS: [bd, vrf]
      TASK 03 - ENSURE TENANT BRIDGE DOMAINS AND EXIST  TAGS: [bd]
      TASK 04 - ENSURE BRIDGE DOMAINS HAVE SUBNETS  TAGS: []
      TASK 05 - ENSURE TENANT FILTERS EXIST TAGS: [contract, filter]
      TASK 06 - ENSURE FILTERS HAVE FILTER ENTRIES  TAGS: [contract, filter]
      TASK 07 - ENSURE TENANT CONTRACTS EXIST TAGS: [contract]
      TASK 08 - ENSURE CONTRACTS HAVE CONTRACT SUBJECTS TAGS: [contract]
      TASK 09 - ENSURE CONTRACT SUBJECTS HAVE FILTERS TAGS: [contract]
      TASK 10 - ENSURE APPLICATION EXISTS TAGS: [app, epg]
      TASK 11 - ENSURE APPLICATION EPGS EXISTS  TAGS: [epg]
      TASK 12 - ENSURE DOMAIN IS BOUND TO EPG TAGS: [epg]
      TASK 13 - ENSURE EPGS HAVE CONTRACTS  TAGS: [epg]
$
```

The output shows the playbook has 1 play with 10 tasks. Each task will ensure the necessary configuration exists for an Application. The `TAGS` at the end of each task are a way to execute a subset of tasks in the playbook. We have provided tags to the tasks so that all dependencies for a task will executed when the tag is used. For example, all tasks in this playbook require the Tenant object to exist, so the task for ensuring the Tenant exists includes every tag used in the play.

### Vars File

Open the `vars/intranet_vars_full_config.yml` to view the configuration variables for our Application.

```yaml
---
tenant: CHANGEME
vrf: "prod_vrf"
bridge_domains:
  - bd: "prod_bd"
    gateway: "10.1.100.1"
    mask: "24"
    scope: "public"
ap: "intranet"
epgs:
  - epg: "web"
    bd: "prod_bd"
    encap: "21"
  - epg: "db"
    bd: "prod_bd"
    encap: "22"
epg_contracts:
  - epg: "web"
    contract: "web"
    contract_type: "provider"
  - epg: "web"
    contract: "sql"
    contract_type: "consumer"
  - epg: "db"
    contract: "sql"
    contract_type: "provider"
contracts:
  - contract: "web"
    subject: "https"
    filter: "https"
  - contract: "sql"
    subject: "sql"
    filter: "sql"
filters:
  - filter: "https"
    entry: "https"
    protocol: "tcp"
    port: "443"
  - filter: "sql"
    entry: "sql"
    protocol: "tcp"
    port: "1433"
```

This file is similar to the vars file we used for the previous playbook, but this one has the full application configurations. This file is the standard format for what the playbook expects, so this file can be used as a template to build configurations for all future applications.

## Execute the Playbook Using Tags
We have mentioned throughtout this lab that the modules are idempotent. In order to demonstrate this, you can run this playbook, passing in this vars file. In order to limit what tasks to just plays related to the Bridge Domain, use the `--tags` argument (or `-t` for short).

```bash
$ ansible-playbook 05_aci_deploy_app.yml -i inventory --extra-vars "@./vars/intranet_vars_full_config.yml" --tags bd

PLAY [ENSURE APPLICATION CONFIGURATION EXISTS] ************************************************************************

TASK [TASK 01 - ENSURE APPLICATIONS TENANT EXISTS] ********************************************************************
ok: [sandboxapicdc.cisco.com]

TASK [TASK 02 - ENSURE TENANT VRF EXISTS] *****************************************************************************
ok: [sandboxapicdc.cisco.com]

TASK [TASK 03 - ENSURE TENANT BRIDGE DOMAINS AND EXIST] ***************************************************************
ok: [sandboxapicdc.cisco.com] => (item={u'bd': u'prod_bd', u'scope': u'public', u'mask': u'24', u'gateway': u'10.1.100.1'})

PLAY RECAP ************************************************************************************************************
sandboxapicdc.cisco.com    : ok=3    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0

$
```

Using the `bd` tag for this playbook resulting in just the first three tasks being executed; the first two are dependencies for the Bridge Domain object, so they also include the `bd` tag.

Also notice that this time the `changed` value is equal to 0. This is because the modules are idempotent, and these configurations were applied earlier in this lab.
